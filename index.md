# Welcome to my wood projects page

This is mainly a place for me to drop and save the projects I have worked on.

They may not be pretty, neither with good plan for reproducibility, but I made them with my bare HANDS!!!! And some tools.

1. [Screen Raiser](./projects/p1-screen-raiser/screen-raiser.md)
1. [Stool Renovation](./projects/p2-stool-reno/stool-reno.md)
1. [Boart Carving](./projects/p3-boat/boat.md)
